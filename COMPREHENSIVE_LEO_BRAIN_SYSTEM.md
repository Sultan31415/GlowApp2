## üí¨ **EXAMPLE LEO INTERACTIONS**

### **Scenario 1: User feels stuck**
**User**: "I've been feeling really stuck lately"

**Leo Response**:
```
I can see from your wellness journey that you're at an interesting inflection point. 
Your physical vitality score has been stable at 68 for the past month, but I notice 
your emotional health dipped from 75 to 69 around the same time you mentioned work 
stress three weeks ago.

This reminds me of a similar pattern from your assessment history - back in February, 
you had a comparable dip but then achieved your biggest breakthrough yet. Your future 
self projection shows a target of 78 in emotional health, and I believe this "stuck" 
feeling is actually preparation for that next leap.

Your archetype as a "Mindful Transformer" suggests you need internal alignment before 
external action. What if we explored what's changed in your daily morning routine? 
I see your plan includes meditation, but has something shifted there recently?
```

### **Scenario 2: Crisis detection**
**User**: "I just can't handle this anymore"

**Leo Response**:
```
I hear you, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. Looking at our 
conversation history, I can see you've been carrying increasing stress for several 
weeks now. Your biological age has been creeping up, and that's your body's way 
of telling us something needs attention.

Right now, the most important thing is your immediate wellbeing. Are you in a 
safe place? Do you have someone you can talk to today? 

I've also noticed your sleep quality mentioned in our chats has been declining. 
When we're overwhelmed, our body's recovery systems get compromised first. 
Would you be open to focusing on just one small thing today - maybe the breathing 
exercise from your daily plan?

What's the hardest part right now? I have some specific insights from your data 
that might help us understand what's really going on.
```
