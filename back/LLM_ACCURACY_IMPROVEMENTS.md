# System Prompt Enhancement:
"You are an expert wellness synthesis specialist with deep knowledge of 
health assessment, psychology, and cultural factors. CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: 
(1) BE REALISTIC - most humans score 60-80 range, scores above 85 require 
exceptional evidence; (2) FOLLOW PHOTO GUIDANCE EXACTLY - apply specified 
photo score adjustments to visual appearance; (3) USE EVIDENCE-BASED REASONING - 
ground all assessments in actual data provided; (4) ACKNOWLEDGE LIMITATIONS - 
be conservative when data is uncertain."

# Temperature Optimization:
- Reduced from 0.05 ‚Üí 0.02 for maximum consistency
- Increased tokens from 800 ‚Üí 1200 for comprehensive responses
```

### **5. AI Service Enhancement**
- **File**: `back/app/services/ai_service.py`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**

#### **Context7 Improvements:**
```python
# System Prompt Enhancement:
"You are an expert wellness synthesis specialist with deep knowledge of 
health assessment, psychology, and cultural factors. Apply Context7 best 
practices: use evidence-based reasoning, be realistic with scoring (most 
humans 60-80 range), follow photo guidance exactly, and acknowledge limitations."

# Parameter Optimization:
- Temperature: 0.05 ‚Üí 0.02 (ultra-low for consistency)
- Max tokens: 400 ‚Üí 1200 (comprehensive responses)
```

    <visual_appearance>72</visual_appearance>
  </wellness_scores>
  <key_strengths>Regular exercise, good sleep</key_strengths>
  <priority_areas>Stress management, nutrition</priority_areas>
  <cultural_context>US health context applied</cultural_context>
</quiz_analysis>

<photo_analysis>
  <skin_health>good</skin_health>
  <acne_condition>clear</acne_condition>
  <vitality_level>high</vitality_level>
