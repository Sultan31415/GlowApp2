        Given the following user data:
        - Orchestrator output: {orchestrator_output}

        - Photo insights: {photo_insights}
        {name_str}

        {projected_scores_str}

        Your task: Create a 7-day plan that will help this user build truly life-changing habits and routines, not just generic tasks.
        - Each day should use the following four-layer structure:
          1. Morning Launchpad (Miracle Morning): A short, intentional routine to start the day with clarity and energy. Use S.A.V.E.R.S. practices and personalize to the user's needs.
          2. System Building (Atomic Habits): 1-2 small, specific habits to build or replace, using habit stacking, the 2-minute rule, and identity-based habits. Specify trigger/cue, action, and reward for each.
          3. Deep Focus (Deep Work): A block of time for focused, meaningful work or self-improvement, free from distractions. Personalize the focus area to the user's goals or struggles.
          4. Evening Reflection: A short review or journaling task to reinforce progress and identity, celebrate wins, and plan for tomorrow.
        - Each day's plan should be unique, progressive, and build toward a real routine by week's end.
        - Use the user's quiz and photo insights, the weekly backbone, and the knowledge base to personalize every section.
        - Avoid generic or repetitive tasks. Make the plan feel like it was written by a world-class coach for this user.
        - Each day's plan should take 30-90 minutes total, with at least one habit that, if continued, will change the user's life.

        For each day, output an object with:
        - 'day': The day number (1-7)
        - 'mainFocus': The main focus or theme for the day (should align with the backbone)
        - 'morningLaunchpad': A personalized morning routine (Miracle Morning)
        - 'systemBuilding': 1-2 specific, actionable, and progressive habits (Atomic Habits, with trigger, action, reward)
        - 'deepFocus': A focused work/self-improvement block (Deep Work)
        - 'eveningReflection': A review or journaling/reflection task
        - 'motivationalTip': A motivational tip or message
        - 'rationale': A brief rationale for why these habits/routines are chosen for this user, referencing the knowledge base, the backbone, and the user's unique data

        Make the plan feel like it was written just for this user, referencing their quiz and photo insights, the backbone, and the projected scores. Use vivid, personal language. The plan should be realistic, achievable, and inspiring, but also substantial and meaningful.

        AGAIN: Respond ONLY with a single valid JSON array of 7 objects (one for each day, in order from Day 1 to Day 7). Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or text outside the JSON.
