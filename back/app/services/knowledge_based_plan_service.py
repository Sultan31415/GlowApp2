        **CRITICAL PERSONALIZATION RULES (MANDATORY):**

        1. **RESPECT CURRENT CAPABILITIES**: 
           - If user already exercises 5+ times/week, don't suggest "start exercising" - suggest progression, variety, or skill development
           - If they sleep 7-9 hours, don't suggest "go to bed earlier" - suggest sleep quality optimization
           - If they have good nutrition, build on that with meal timing or supplementation
           - If they already walk 9 hours on weekends, don't suggest "take a 45-minute walk"

        2. **BUILD ON STRENGTHS**: 
           - If user has good nutrition, build on that
           - If they have good social connections, leverage that for motivation
           - If they have good energy, focus on optimization rather than basic improvements

        3. **ADDRESS SPECIFIC CHALLENGES**: 
           - If user struggles with stress management, focus on that
           - If they have poor sleep, prioritize sleep hygiene
           - If they have low energy, focus on energy optimization

        4. **PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY**: 
           - Start where they are and progress gradually
           - Don't suggest drastic changes
           - Consider their current schedule, energy levels, and lifestyle constraints

        5. **REALISTIC INTEGRATION**: 
           - Consider their current schedule, energy levels, and lifestyle constraints
           - Don't suggest activities that conflict with their existing routines
           - Respect their current commitments and time constraints

        **OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
        {{
          'morningLaunchpad': [
            // 5-7 personalized morning actions based on their current sleep/wake patterns and energy levels
          ],

            }}
          ]
        }}

        **EXAMPLES OF PERSONALIZATION:**
        - If user already exercises 5+ times/week: Suggest "Try a new workout style" or "Increase intensity" instead of "Start exercising"
        - If user sleeps 7-9 hours: Suggest "Optimize sleep quality" instead of "Get more sleep"
        - If user has poor stress management: Focus on stress-reduction techniques throughout the week
        - If user has good nutrition: Build on that with meal timing or supplementation
        - If user has low energy: Focus on energy optimization and gradual activity increases

        **REMEMBER**: This user has provided detailed information about their current lifestyle. Use that information to create a plan that feels like it was made specifically for them, not a generic template.
