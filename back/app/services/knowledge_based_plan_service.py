            }},

        The response must be a single valid JSON object that can be parsed directly.

        Given the following user data:
        - Orchestrator output: {orchestrator_output}
        - Quiz insights: {quiz_insights}
        - Photo insights: {photo_insights}
        {name_str}

        {knowledge_summary}
        {backbone_str}
        {projected_scores_str}

        Your task:

        1. Create ONE morning routine (Miracle Morning) for the entire week ‚Äî a list of 5-7 short, trackable actions like ["Wake up", "Drink water", "Stretch", ...], personalized to the user's context.

        2. Create a detailed 7-day plan ("days") where each day includes:
            - mainFocus: key theme of the day
            - systemBuilding: 1-2 concrete, physical habits (Atomic Habits structure). Example:
              {{
                "trigger": "After lunch",
                "action": "Take a 15-min walk",
                "reward": "Clear mind and refreshed energy"
              }}
            - deepFocus: personalized 30‚Äì60 min session of uninterrupted focus (Deep Work)
            - eveningReflection: simple journal or reflection action
            - motivationalTip: motivating sentence
            - Each habit must be unique, specific, and real-world ‚Äî no vague or generic instructions.

        3. Create exactly 2 or 3 weekly challenges under the "challenges" section. Prioritize the most relevant categories based on the user‚Äôs needs, quiz insights, and photo insights. Choose the types of challenges that would most benefit the user's emotional, physical, or mental state this week.
            - Each challenge should fall into one of these categories: Learning, Leisure, Physical, Social, Mindfulness, Creative
            - Each challenge must be:
                - actionable (e.g. ‚ÄúVisit a new place and take 3 photos‚Äù)
                - clearly described
                - doable within the week
                - engaging and slightly outside of user's current routine
            - Include a brief rationale for each challenge

        Do NOT include all categories (Learning, Leisure, Social, etc.). Pick only a few that feel the most important for this user's current situation. This makes the plan more focused and less overwhelming.

        AGAIN: Respond ONLY with a single valid JSON object. Do NOT include any explanation or text outside the JSON.
