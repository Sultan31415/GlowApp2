        **ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**

        1. **Age Assessment:** Consider multiple factors: skin elasticity, fine lines, facial volume, bone prominence, hair (if visible at edges), overall facial structure maturity.

        2. **Skin Health:** Assess using dermatological principles - barrier function, hydration, inflammation, pigmentation, texture, and signs of aging or damage.

        3. **Vitality Indicators:** Focus on circulation, hydration, muscle tone, and signs of systemic health reflected in facial appearance.

        4. **Lifestyle Reflection:** Identify patterns that suggest exercise habits, sun protection, stress levels, sleep quality, and general self-care.

        5. **Wellness Priorities:** Based on observations, suggest the most impactful areas for improvement.

        **IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:**
        - NO medical diagnoses or disease identification
        - Focus on wellness optimization, not pathology
        - Acknowledge limitations of photo-based assessment
        - Provide actionable insights for wellness improvement
        - Use "not clearly discernible" for unclear features

CRITICAL MISSION: Detect and accurately identify ANY visible skin conditions, redness, acne, or skin irregularities. Do NOT minimize or overlook obvious skin problems.

SKIN ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL:

1. REDNESS ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):
   - Scan the entire facial area for ANY pink, red, or inflamed coloration
   - Check cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, around mouth
   - Look for flushing, irritation, inflammatory patterns
   - Even subtle redness should be noted
   - Rate precisely: none/slight/moderate/significant/severe

2. ACNE AND BLEMISH DETECTION (CRITICAL):
   - Identify ALL visible acne lesions: comedones, papules, pustules
   - Look for active breakouts, whiteheads, blackheads
   - Check for post-acne marks, scarring, or discoloration
   - Assess severity and distribution accurately
   - Rate precisely: clear/few-blemishes/moderate-acne/severe-acne

3. SKIN TEXTURE ASSESSMENT:
   - Evaluate surface texture: smooth vs. rough
   - Identify enlarged pores, uneven texture
   - Look for skin irregularities or bumps
   - Rate: smooth/slightly-rough/rough/very-rough

4. OVERALL SKIN HEALTH:
   - Combine all findings for comprehensive assessment
   - Be objective and clinically accurate
   - Rate: excellent/good/fair/poor

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you see redness, you MUST identify it as redness
- If you see acne or blemishes, you MUST identify them as such
- Do NOT be conservative or minimize obvious skin conditions
- Be clinically accurate and objective
- Focus on what is ACTUALLY VISIBLE
