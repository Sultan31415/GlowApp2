        **PROJECTION FRAMEWORKS:**

        **1. 7-DAY "IGNITION WEEK" (Rapid Momentum & Felt Difference)**
        This phase is about immediate, high-impact interventions that create a palpable shift in the user's well-being. The goal is for the user to *feel* the differenceâ€”more energetic, less bloated, clearer-headed, or visibly more vibrantâ€”within days. This builds crucial early momentum and trust.

        * **Focus Areas:**
            * **Fundamental Biological Optimization:** Targeted hydration, light exposure, basic movement resets (e.g., posture breaks, short walks).
            * **Instant Calm & Focus:** Simple breathwork, short mindfulness anchors.
            * **Digestive Harmony:** Gentle dietary adjustments (e.g., increased fiber, mindful eating).
            * **Rejuvenating Sleep Rituals:** Establishing a consistent pre-sleep routine.
            * **Immediate Visual Brightening:** Basic skin hydration, posture awareness.
        * **Scoring Guidelines (7-day improvements):** 3-8 points per category. These are felt, not necessarily dramatic, but significant enough to be noticed.
            * Overall Glow Score: +4-12 points.

        **2. 30-DAY "DEEP DIVE TRANSFORMATION" (Sustainable Change & Visible Progress)**
        Building on the Ignition Week, this phase integrates deeper, more sustainable lifestyle shifts. The focus is on compounding habits, establishing routines, and creating visible, measurable changes across all dimensions of well-being.

        * **Focus Areas:**
            * **Metabolic & Nutritional Refinement:** Deeper dietary strategy, consistent meal timing.
            * **Progressive Physical Conditioning:** Structured exercise, improved strength/endurance.
            * **Advanced Stress Resilience:** Deeper mindfulness practices, emotional regulation techniques.
            * **Restorative Sleep Architecture:** Optimizing sleep environment, addressing sleep disruptions.
            * **Enhanced Radiance & Presence:** Advanced skin care integration, self-care rituals, confidence building.
        * **Scoring Guidelines (30-day improvements):** 8-20 points per category. These are substantial, visible, and enduring.
            * Overall Glow Score: +10-25 points.

        **ALL PROJECTED SCORES MUST BE BETWEEN 0 AND 100. NEVER EXCEED 100.**
        **IMPORTANT RULE:** For each projected score, add the specified increment to the current value, but if the result is greater than 100, set it to 100. For example, if the current score is 95 and the increment is +12, the projected score must be 100 (not 107). Never allow any projected score to be above 100, no matter what. Your projections should be highly motivational, but always grounded in realistic, achievable progress.

            - Begin as if you are the same person, 30 days apart. Do NOT use formal greetings like 'Dear [Name]'. Instead, start with a direct, familiar line (e.g., 'Hey, it's me. 30 days from now.').
            - Briefly acknowledge the user's current state, feelings, or what led them to start, based on quiz_insights, photo_insights, and orchestrator_output.
            - Anticipate the emotional struggles, physical/visual insecurities, and transformation progress the user is likely to experience.
            - Reference 1-2 *very specific* moments, habits, or feelings the user will recognize or soon encounter. These should be different for each user, and should be drawn from their unique quiz_insights, photo_insights, and orchestrator_output. Do not always use the same example (such as "on Day 3 when you think about skipping that walk"); instead, vary the moments and habits based on the user's data, and randomize the day, activity, or challenge referenced.
            - Ensure that the specific moments, days, and habits referenced are not repeated across users, and are personalized and varied each time.
            - Use vivid, sensory, and personal language. Be warm, real, and a bit rawâ€”like a private journal entry sent back in time, not generic motivation or over-coaching.
            - Emphasize the continuity of self: remind the user that 'I am you, just 30 days ahead', and that this transformation is already within them.
            - Use the user's name at least once.{name_str}
            - Be between 120 and 140 words.
            - End with a line that feels like a whisper through time, e.g., 'See you in 30 days', 'I'll be waiting for you', or 'Weâ€™re closer than you think.'"

        Ensure the 'rationaleSummary' for both 7-day and 30-day projections clearly articulates *how* the projected improvements will be felt or seen by the user, connecting them back to the initial insights. The 'messageFromFutureSelf' is critical â€“ make it deeply resonant and personal based on *all* available data.
